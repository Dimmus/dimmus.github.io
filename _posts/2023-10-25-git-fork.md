================

1. List the current remotes
<pre id="code">
git remote -v
</pre>

2.  Add the remote, call it "upstream"
<pre id="code">
git remote add upstream https://git.enlightenment.org/enlightenment/efl.git
</pre>

3. Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches
<pre id="code">
git fetch upstream
</pre>

4. Make sure that you're on your master branch:
<pre id="code">
git checkout master
</pre>

5. Stash the changes of your "master" branch:
<pre id="code">
git stash
</pre>

6. Rewrite your master branch so that any commits of yours that aren't already in upstream/master are replayed on top of that other branch:
<pre id="code">
git rebase upstream/master
</pre>
At this stage you check that commits what will be merged by typing `git status`. If you don't want to rewrite the history of your master branch, (for example because other people may have cloned it) then you should replace the last command with `git merge upstream/master`.

Instead of the rebase command, you can use the following: 
<pre id="code">
git merge --no-ff upstream/master 
</pre>
This way your commits aren't on top anymore.

7. If you've rebased your branch onto `upstream/master` you may need to force the push in order to push it to your own forked repository on GitHub. You'd do that with:
<pre id="code">
git push -f origin master
</pre>
You only need to use the `-f` the first time after you've rebased.

8. Get back your stashed changes (if any)
<pre id="code">
git stash pop
</pre>
